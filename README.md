java Main2 <<enter your numbers here>>
```

### Task 3: print those numbers whose length is less than the average length over all numbers, print their length.
```bash
javac Main3.java
java Main3 <<enter your numbers here>>
```

### Task 4: find the number that consists of the least number of different digits. Find the first one if there are several.

```

### Task 5: Find the amount of numbers containing only even digits, and among the remaining ones, find the amount of numbers with an equal number of even and odd digits. Find the first one if there are several.
```bash
javac Main5.java
java Main5 <<enter your numbers here>>
```

```bash
javac Main6.java
java Main6 <<enter your numbers here>>
```
